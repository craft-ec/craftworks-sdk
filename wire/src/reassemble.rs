//! Putting a chunked reply back together, with the bounds a stranger's input
//! needs.
//!
//! # Why this exists rather than stdlib's buffer alone
//!
//! stdlib's `ReassemblyBuffer` already bounds what matters most — it refuses a
//! `total` over its cap BEFORE allocating the slot vector, which is the
//! allocation a hostile sender would otherwise choose the size of. This wraps
//! it rather than replacing it, so that bound is theirs and stays theirs.
//!
//! What it adds is the thing that is missing **on wasm specifically**:
//! `ReassemblyBuffer::evict_stale` is `#[cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))]`.
//! In a browser nothing ages a half-finished stream out, and the buffer holds
//! at most `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` (8) of them — so eight abandoned streams
//! wedge reassembly permanently, and the symptom is replies that simply stop
//! arriving. A node that started eight messages and finished none would do it
//! on purpose; a flaky connection would do it by accident.
//!
//! So this counts streams itself and drops the oldest when it must, which
//! turns a permanent wedge into a lost message — and a lost message is
//! something the layers above already handle, because delivery was never
//! guaranteed.
