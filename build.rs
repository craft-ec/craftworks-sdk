//! Bake into the wasm what this build IS.
//!
//! The builder copies a built SDK into its own tree and records the rev it
//! asked for beside it. Nothing can currently check that those two agree,
//! because the rev is not inside the wasm — so a stale copy compares equal to
//! a fresh one. This file is what puts it in.
//!
//! The rev must come from the SOURCE, never from the caller. The builder
//! fetches the SDK with `git archive <rev> | tar -x`, so passing the rev in as
//! an environment variable would make the check circular: both sides of the
//! comparison would come from `SDK_REV` and a stale wasm would still match.
//! `git archive` substitutes `$Format:…$` in files marked `export-subst`, so
//! `src/build_rev.txt` carries the real commit inside an archive and the
//! literal placeholder in an ordinary checkout — where `git rev-parse` answers
//! instead.
