//! Does the engine build the bytes the Block contract defines?
//!
//! `engine/src/pack.rs` is a second implementation of a format whose authority
//! lives in `freenet-contracts/block/src/pack.rs`. Two spellings of one format
//! drift, and the drift does not show up here — it shows up as a host refusing
//! a commit, in production, with nothing to point at.
//!
//! So this is a differential, not a self-test: the vectors were produced BY
//! the contract's own `build`, and the engine has to reproduce them byte for
//! byte. A test that checked the engine against its own output would pass
//! forever no matter how far the two drifted.
