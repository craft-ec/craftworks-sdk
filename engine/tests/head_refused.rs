//! A FINAL SIGN REFUSAL ENDS THE COMMIT (PUBLISH-LIFE ⁵, E8; COMMIT-LIFE's Heading x head refused, Committing x head
//! refused). The signer's final refusal is a real answer (rule 8): the page steps `Event::HeadRefused { seq }` and the
//! engine ends that commit at once -- every write of its cut `Failed` -- never leaving it to hang until its own clock
//! calls it `Stalled`. A refusal naming any other seq is stale and changes nothing.
