//! RACE GET (the owner's rule 11, sdk#303): a read asks ALL `k + m` blocks of a sibling group at once and
//! finishes on the first `k`.
//!
//! The case racing exists for is SILENCE: a member the network never answers -- no NotFound, nothing. Before
//! racing, the group was asked only after the member was answered NotFound, so a silent member held its read for
//! ever. Here a member is silent:
//! * racing on: every read is answered right, the member rebuilt from its group and verified;
//! * THE CONTROL, racing off: the read on the silent member is never answered.
//!
//! And the race's hygiene (the architect's review, docs/reviews/sdk303-race-get-attack.md):
//! * each block is asked ONCE per read, however many members of its group race it;
//! * what a finished race no longer wants is WITHDRAWN (the page drops its GET);
//! * a slot whose bytes do not hash to it never counts toward `k`.
