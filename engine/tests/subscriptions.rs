//! Acceptance for range subscriptions (craftworks-sdk#44 part 2).
//!
//! The claim under test is not "a notification arrives". It is **exactly one
//! per commit, and none at all for a range the commit did not touch** — and
//! the second half is the one that can pass for the wrong reason, because a
//! test that subscribes to an untouched range and sees nothing looks identical
//! whether the range filter works or the notification machinery is simply not
//! wired up.
//!
//! So every "none" assertion here runs beside a control that makes the
//! notification actually happen: the same commit, the same engine, with
//! `notify_without_diff` on. If the control is silent the test fails on the
//! control, naming the real problem, instead of passing on the assertion.
