//! W8 — A WRITE NAMES WHAT IT READ (sdk#235, M2 ruling 1; WRITE-PATH.md).
//!
//! Every key a write changes has a read entry, or the engine refuses the write
//! as `Unread` AT THE DOOR: syntactic (the write's own op keys against its own
//! read keys), before any other answer, reading no state. So it can never
//! follow `Accepted` — including for a write parked before its head, which is
//! answered `Accepted` at once (sdk#223).
