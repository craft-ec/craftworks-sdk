//! A commit that hears nothing (COMMIT-LIFE rev 5, C5; rule 8 "No time cut-offs"): SILENCE NEVER ENDS IT. A Racing
//! commit's PUTs re-send in `Page::send` until answered -- the engine re-puts nothing on a clock and ends nothing on
//! one -- and a Heading commit's head is ASKED about on its pace (E12), a question whose answer is E6, E7 or E8. The
//! later writes QUEUE behind it (K1: never `Busy`).
//!
//! (Before sdk#481 a silent Racing commit was re-put from its carried ops and, past three settle rounds or with ops
//! too large to carry, ended `Lost`: sdk#150 E1/E2, delegate-era. The two tests that pinned it are rewritten below to
//! the C5 cell.)
