//! sdk#150: the engine's clock survives the call.
//!
//! `in_flight_since` joined the context in sdk#81 and the clock it is
//! measured against did not, so every call but a Tick's began at `now = 0`.
//! Two consequences, pinned here with the engine rebuilt from its context on
//! EVERY step, as a delegate is:
//!
//! * a commit started in a call with no Tick took `in_flight_since = 0`, and
//!   against an epoch-seconds tick was `Stalled` at once;
//! * a commit's age was measured from the wrong moment, so `Stalled` came at
//!   the wrong tick -- the carried clock is what makes it exactly
//!   `max_accept_age` ticks after the commit started.
