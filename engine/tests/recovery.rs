//! This is the phase's promise: the engine is dropped at every state boundary

//! It is also the reason slice 1 is a pure state machine. A crash at a
//! precise moment is an ordinary value being dropped here; against a live
//! node it is a race nobody can schedule.

/// The context is lost while a head is in flight, and a client can still find

///
/// The context cache is an in-process `DashMap` with a 10-minute TTL, never
/// written to disk: a node restart loses it outright, and so does ten idle
/// minutes. The engine that comes back has no memory of the write at all.
///
/// So the answer cannot come from the engine's memory — it has none — and it
/// must not be a guess. It comes from re-reading the HEAD, which is the one
/// durable record. `AskWrite` about a write the engine does not know gets NO
/// verdict (sdk#196 review): "unknown" is also what an engine says about a
/// write it published and forgot, so `Lost` there would be a guess. The
/// client's timeout is what hands the write back for re-submitting.
///
/// Both halves are asserted, because they differ in what a re-submit does:
///   (a) the head LANDED — re-submitting is a no-op against the same tree;
///   (b) it did NOT — re-submitting reproduces exactly the intended tree.
