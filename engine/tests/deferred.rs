//! DEFERRED WRITES (sdk#350): a write can say "commit only in company". The
//! owner's rule is that VIEWING writes nothing, and a published app's schema
//! defines on its own tree are sent at open; marked deferred they are held,
//! `Accepted`, until the person's first write, and then ride that write's cut.
//!
//! * defines alone: no cut, however long they wait;
//! * the first data write: ONE cut carrying the defines and the write;
//! * a define NOT deferred (the builder's) commits alone, as before;
//! * a data write that is REFUSED takes nothing with it: the defines stay held;
//! * a held define is not UNSAVED (nothing the person made).
