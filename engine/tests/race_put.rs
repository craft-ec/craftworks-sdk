//! RACE PUT's accounting (COMMIT-LIFE §P), driven through the engine's own
//! events with the acks under the test's control:
//!
//! * SUPERSEDED stragglers: a later commit that re-codes a group an earlier
//!   commit is still putting WITHDRAWS the earlier commit's blocks there, and
//!   the earlier write is BACKED_UP with the newer version of the group --
//!   not before it is full, and not never.
//! * VALUE blocks are never withdrawn: the same value under two keys is one
//!   block, so a removed leaf's value may still be needed.
//! * The head's race set: an earlier commit's straggler is NEVER counted
//!   present toward a group's k, and `after` names only this commit's acked
//!   blocks.
