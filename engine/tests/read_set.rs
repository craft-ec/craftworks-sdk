//! THE READ SET (sdk#148): a write states what it READ, and the engine checks
//! it against the tree the ops land on, inside that same apply (R0). A read
//! that no longer holds applies NOTHING and ends `Conflict`, beside an
//! `Effect::Conflicted` naming the key and what it holds now.
//!
//! R1 a conflicting write never changes the tree;
//! R2 a write whose reads hold applies exactly as the same write with none;
//! R3 two updates from one stale view: one applies, the other conflicts;
//! R4 `create_at` twice on one key: one creates, the other conflicts;
//! and the architect's attack: a value stored by REFERENCE is compared by its
//! reference, never fetched to be compared; a read key whose path is not held
//! PARKS (never a Conflict) and is checked again on the root it resumes on.
