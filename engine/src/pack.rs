//! A commit's blocks in one PUT, and the manifest that makes the network the

//! here is what the format deliberately does not decide: the kind a pack is
//! stored under, each kind's ceiling (the Block contract's numbers), and the
//! commit manifest.
//!
//! ```text
//! pack     = "PK01" ‖ count:u16 ‖ member*
//! member   = kind:u8 ‖ len:u32 ‖ bytes
//! manifest = "CM01" ‖ prev_seq:u64 ‖ prev_root:32 ‖ seq:u64 ‖ root:32
//!                   ‖ groups:u32 ‖ (parity ids: 3 × 32)*
//! ```
//!
//! Members are strictly ascending BY BLOCK ID, so a set has one encoding and
//! two writers packing the same commit produce the same pack.
