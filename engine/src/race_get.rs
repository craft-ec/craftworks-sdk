//! RACE GET (the owner's rule 11, sdk#303): a read asks ALL `k + m` blocks of a sibling group and finishes on the
//! first `k`, repairing from parity.
//!
//! #300's repair already does the second half: given a group, it asks every other block of it at once, counts
//! what arrives (each checked by hash against its slot, parity included), rebuilds the missing member at `k`,
//! verifies it, and hands it to the page as a block to keep, where it lands like any arrival. What it did not do
//! was START until the member itself had been answered NotFound -- and a member that is SILENT is never answered,
//! so its read waited on the slowest block. Racing starts that gather the FIRST time a read wants the member:
//!
//! - the member is asked, as before, and so is the rest of its group, at once (point reads too: rule 11 as
//!   written; a "race only after an RTO" hedge would amend it, and is not built);
//! - whichever comes first ends it: the member itself (`on_arrived` ends its repair), or any `k` of the group
//!   (rebuilt and verified);
//! - each block is asked ONCE however many members race it (`start_repair` does not re-ask a slot in flight);
//! - what a finished race no longer wants is WITHDRAWN (`Effect::Unwanted`, net at the call's end): the page drops its GET instead
//!   of re-asking it for ever, and does not keep it if it arrives late;
//! - the group is found in the parent held under the read's OWN pinned root (another root's parity would not
//!   match); the root is a group of ONE (sdk#335) when its head listed its parity -- the first of its `1 + m` to
//!   arrive answers -- and is fetched singly when it did not.
//!
//! Stragglers need nothing here: the page re-sends a GET on its RTO with no count (rule 7), and a block that
//! arrives after its group resolved is either used (someone still waits) or dropped (withdrawn).
