//! The write pipeline as a pure state machine.
//!
//! `step(event) -> Vec<Effect>`: no sockets, no clock, no randomness. Every
//! interleaving a live node can produce — responses out of order, a PUT that
//! never acknowledges, a duplicate confirmation, a restart mid-commit — is an
//! ordinary deterministic test here instead of a flake against a real network.
//!
//! **Effects carry dependencies, never a batch size.** How many operations fit
//! in one delegate round is a platform fact that has already changed once
//! (F15, F21) and is the shell's business. The core says what must happen
//! before what; the shell decides how many at a time.
//!
//! The states a write moves through, and what each one promises:
//!
//! | state | promise |
//! |---|---|
//! | `Accepted` | applied to the tree, not yet shipped. Survives a tab close, NOT a node restart. |
//! | `Stalled` | the commit carrying it cannot publish, and is not moving. Non-terminal, reported once. |
//! | `Published` | packs read back, THEN the head read back. Survives a restart, and what a UI may call "saved". |
//! | `ParityComplete` | the redundancy the new nodes promise actually exists. |
//! | `Busy` | TERMINAL, and nothing was applied: a commit was already in flight, or a cap was reached. The client still holds the write and may re-submit it. |
//! | `Failed` | TERMINAL. The edit is NOT in the tree and never will be, so a re-submit applies it once. Never reported for a write whose edit IS in the tree. |
//! | `Lost` | TERMINAL. The commit carrying it will not publish and the engine no longer has it; the client is the only thing that does. |
//!
//! Between `Published` and `ParityComplete` the tree is correct and its groups
//! have no redundancy. That is *absent redundancy, not an error*
//! (ARCHITECTURE §7): a keeper's repair and the writer's late put are the same
//! bytes under the same id, so nothing has to be flagged, only done.
//!
//! # THE RULE FOR ADDING ANYTHING HERE
//!
//! **The engine is LONG-LIVED in the page (READ-STATE, design B).** The page holds one `Engine` for its life
//! and drives it call by call, so a field keeps its value across calls, in memory. A race's and a repair's state
//! live there (sdk#303), as the reads' own bookkeeping does.
//!
//! It was not always so. In the delegate era every `process()` call got a fresh linear memory (F32): the engine
//! was rebuilt from a CONTEXT the last call wrote, thrown away at the end of the call, and only what that
//! context carried survived. Nothing re-hydrates any more, and the carry was deleted (#305); the context
//! BUDGET it left behind (`keep_saveable`, `context_len`) is sdk#385's question.
//!
//! In that era a field held its default at the top of every call but the one that set it, and four defects of
//! exactly that shape were invisible to every test that drove one process:
//!
//! * `in_flight_since` (sdk#81) — the stall timer. `None` at the top of every
//!   call but the one that started the commit, so `Stalled` could never be
//!   reported at all;
//! * `told_stalled` (sdk#81) — which writes had been told. Without it the
//!   notice repeats on every tick, which is noise a caller learns to ignore;
//! * `in_flight_parity` (sdk#83) — the map from a parity block to its group.
//!   The ack arrives in a LATER call, so no group ever settled and the same
//!   three blocks went out on every tick for ever;
//! * the delegate scheduler's `confirmed` set (sdk#83) — not engine state,
//!   but the same rule one layer out. It learns what the node holds from
//!   acks in THIS call, so a parity put gated `after: [published_root]` was
//!   held on a dependency nothing would confirm, and dropped. Every call.
//!
//! The question that survives them, for any new field, effect dependency or deadline: **what does this hold
//! after the page RELOADS, and is that the right answer?** A page's memory is gone then; what must outlive it
//! lives on the network (the head, the blocks), and is derived from there -- two copies of one fact can
//! disagree, and a derived one cannot.
//!
//! And an EMISSION is not a fact (sdk#150). An effect the engine returns can
//! be held and dropped by the scheduler, cut by a per-return limit, or never
//! answered; "I asked, therefore it happened" made each of those a permanent
//! loss. What is owed is derived from answers; `asks` only paces re-asking.
//!
//! And the test has to span the RELOAD. An assertion that passes on an engine driven straight through proves
//! nothing about what a fresh page recovers.
