//! Who is watching which range, and what a root move means for them.
//!
//! A subscription is a standing question — "has anything between these two
//! keys changed?" — and the whole difficulty is answering it without reading
//! the tree. The prolly tree makes that cheap in exactly the way this needs:
//! a node's id is the hash of its bytes, so **equal id ⇒ equal subtree**, and
//! `diff` skips whole subtrees on that alone. Two roots that are equal cost
//! ZERO reads, which is the common case on every call where nothing
//! published.
//!
//! So the answer to "did this range change" is a diff restricted to the range,
//! asked for ONE change. Not the changes — whether there are any. A commit
//! that rewrites ten thousand keys outside a subscriber's range costs that
//! subscriber the descent and nothing else.
//!
//! # What a subscription is FOR, and what it is not for
//!
//! **Only data that is actually live.** A subscription is a standing cost —
//! context bytes, a diff on every root move, a push the client must handle —
//! paid continuously, in exchange for hearing about a change without asking.
//! That trade is only worth making where the data CHANGES while someone is
//! looking at it and where the change is worth acting on immediately: a feed,
//! a presence list, a document two people have open, a counter that ticks.
//!
//! For ordinary data it is a loss. A record read once and shown, a schema, a
//! settings blob, a list a person opens and closes — these are read when
//! wanted and are correct at the moment they are read. Subscribing to them
//! buys a notification nobody is waiting for, and it spends a slot that the
//! live data needed.
//!
//! The second half of the test is the DELTA. The reason to be told "something
//! in this range changed" rather than to re-read is that the change is small
//! against the thing it changed — one new row in a long list, one field in a
//! document. Where hearing about a change means re-reading the whole range
//! anyway, a subscription has bought a push instead of a poll and little
//! else. That is why `Changed` carries the root it moved FROM as well as the
//! one it moved to: the pair is what a delta is computed between, and an
//! engine that told a client only where the tree landed would have left it
//! with no way to ask what moved.
//!
//! **Nothing subscribes on a client's behalf.** There is no implicit
//! subscription anywhere above this: no read takes one out, no collection
//! opens one because it was listed. An app names the range and says so,
//! because only the app knows which of its data is live. `max_subscriptions`
//! is deliberately small for the same reason — a cap that comfortably fits
//! "everything this app touches" is a cap that invites it.
//!
//! # What is bounded, and why each bound exists
//!
//! Everything here is held in a delegate's context, which is 400 KiB and is
//! the budget every other thing also comes out of. Two separate bounds:
//!
//! - **How many.** `max_subscriptions`. Over it, the subscribe is REFUSED and
//!   the client is told — never silently dropped, because a client that
//!   believes it is subscribed and is not will wait for ever for a
//!   notification that is not coming.
//! - **How big each one is.** `max_sub_key`. The bounds are client-chosen
//!   byte strings, so without this a single subscription is an allocation the
//!   sender picks the size of — the thing `MAX_MESSAGE` exists to prevent, one
//!   layer in.
