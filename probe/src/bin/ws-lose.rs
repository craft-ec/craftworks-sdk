//! LOSE DATA AT THE READER (builder#176, Phase 4's finish-line demo): a proxy between a READER's page and ITS OWN node
//! that passes everything through, except that the GET answers for the blocks of ONE group become the node's own
//! `NotFound` (`probe::lose` decides which). To that reader the blocks are LOST on the network: a published record
//! must still read, from parity (rule 11), with up to `m` of a group lost -- and must NOT with `m + 1` (the control).
//! Nothing is withheld from any publish and no node's store is touched: the loss is what this reader's node says, so
//! a realnet line that reports it says "V's node answers NotFound for N blocks (ws-lose)", never "a node lost data".
//!
//! A connection that is not a WebSocket upgrade (the node's HTTP: the app's web containers and pieces) is piped through
//! unchanged, and the node is dialled only when a client connects (a harness guard fails on a client connected before
//! the reader's page opens). Every choice, every chosen slot the reader first asks for
//! (`asked`) and every NotFound is a JSON line on stderr: the evidence that the loss happened, and that the reader
//! reached for the group.
//!
//! usage: ws-lose <listen-port> <node-ws-port> --group data|root --lose m|m+1
//!        (both ports on 127.0.0.1; `probe::node::RESERVED` refused)
