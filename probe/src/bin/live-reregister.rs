//! sdk#442, LIVE: DOES A NODE KEEP A DELEGATE'S REGISTRATION ACROSS A RESTART? A page that registered the signer reads
//! the node's "no such delegate" as NOT ANSWERED YET (F59's race) and never registers again -- right only if a
//! registration survives the node's restart. On a private node: register the signer, ask it (the control: it
//! answers), SIGKILL and restart the node on the same data, then ask again WITHOUT registering. An answer = kept; the
//! node's delegate error = lost. The node's own words are printed either way. The negative control: the same ask on a
//! FRESH node that never registered it must be the node's error.
//!
//! Exit status is the verdict (0 kept, 1 lost, 2 could not judge). usage: SIGNER_PORT=<port> live-reregister <signer.wasm>
