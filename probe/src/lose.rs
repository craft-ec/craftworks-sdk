//! LOSE DATA AT THE READER (builder#176, Phase 4's finish-line demo): what `ws-lose` decides, kept apart from its
//! sockets so it is tested on real trees.
//!
//! Between a READER's page and its own node, the blocks of ONE group are made absent: their GET answers become the
//! node's own `NotFound` -- the one answer page-io reads as "absent" (wire `GetFail::NotFound`) -- so to the reader
//! those blocks are LOST on the network. Nothing is withheld from any publish and no node's store is touched: the loss
//! is what this reader's node says. Which group:
//!
//! * [`Target::Data`]: the first node group with `k >= 2` members the reader fetches (a branch's children, or a leaf's
//!   referenced values): losing up to `m` of its `k + m` blocks, DATA members first, makes the reader DECODE from
//!   parity (rule 11), not merely take a copy.
//! * [`Target::Root`]: the root's group of one (`k = 1`, sdk#335), from the head's ledger: every tree has it.
//!
//! `m` is [`PARITY`], read here, never written down. `m` lost is the margin; `m + 1` is the control.
