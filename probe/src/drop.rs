//! DROP BLOCKS AT PUBLISH (sdk#479, REPAIR's real-network step): between a WRITER's page and its node, every `n`th
//! Block-contract PUT's FIRST send is NOT handed to the node, while the page is answered with a `PutResponse` from
//! here, as a node that acked the block and then lost it would. A RE-SEND of it passes (engineer5 on the live step:
//! dropping every re-send made a lost commit ROOT unrecoverable, a network no page can publish on; the page's own
//! re-PUT of its root is what recovers that). The writer publishes as
//! usual; the dropped blocks were never stored anywhere, so a read of the tree finds them MISSING on the network --
//! what REPAIR must put back. (ws-withhold drops only an ANSWER and ws-lose only lies to a reader: neither makes a
//! block absent.) A request split into chunks is held until it is whole, then handed on whole or dropped whole.
//! Every dropped block is a JSON line on stderr ([`dropped_line`]): the run's list of what the network lacks.
