//! sdk#150 PR 3: a person's FIRST save on a fresh tree gets its redundancy.
//!
//! The architect's probe, as a test. Before PR 3, with a tick while the
//! first commit was in flight, its three parity puts went out `after` the
//! empty tree's root -- which nobody puts or confirms -- were held, dropped
//! with the call, and (recorded as `sent`) never asked for again: not after
//! 130 ticks, a Flush, or a second write. Write 1 was told `Published` and
//! never `ParityComplete`. The CONTROL is the same first commit with no tick
//! in flight, which completed then and must still.
