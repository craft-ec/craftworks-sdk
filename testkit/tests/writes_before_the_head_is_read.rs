//! A WRITE MADE BEFORE THE HEAD IS READ (sdk#223's write half).
//!
//! The tree an engine starts on is EMPTY. A write applied to it commits a head
//! that knows nothing of the head the person already has: on a node that holds
//! data, that write publishes a tree with only itself in it, and everything
//! written before is gone from the head everyone reads.
//!
//! The page used to hold such writes itself. The engine now parks the first
//! and answers `Busy` to the rest, and applies the parked one on the RECOVERED
//! root — which is what this checks, against a node that already holds data.
