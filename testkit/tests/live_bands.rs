//! LIVE, per watch key (READ-STATE inv. 5; sdk#137's bands): a change is
//! reported for the binding whose RANGE it falls in, and for no other — a
//! write under parent Q does not re-run a binding of parent P's band, and a
//! head move that changed neither reports neither. The diff is the tree's
//! (`LiveBindings::take_changed` over `PageStore::changes_since`), walked in
//! a real tab over the page path's node.
