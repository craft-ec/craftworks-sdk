//! sdk#178, two writers: two engines on one node, each believing the tree is
//! empty, both commit seq 1. The Register takes the first and refuses the
//! second (an equal seq), answering with the head it holds -- the same seq
//! under ANOTHER root. The second writer must be told `Lost`, never
//! `Published` (the shell compared the seq only); it adopts the head that
//! won, and its re-send publishes at seq 2 with both writes readable.
