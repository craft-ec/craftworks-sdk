//! READ-STATE's MODEL TEST (craftworks-docs docs/design/READ-STATE.md,
//! § The model test).
//!
//! Written BEFORE slice R's code, against the read path of that day (a row
//! copy with range loads), and red there on the defects it exists to see: at
//! ca3f7c4, over seeds 0..40 × 120 steps, "READ IS NOT THE TREE AT ITS HEAD"
//! 8/40, "READ DID NOT ANSWER" (a ticketless NOT_LOADED) 14/40, "AT REST, Y'S
//! READ IS NOT THE FINAL TREE" 5/40. That reader is gone with its code; the
//! controls here are MUTATIONS of the walking reader instead (READ-STATE §
//! The model test, Controls).
//!
//! A seeded PRNG (splitmix64) drives ONE node and two tabs of one person: tab
//! x WRITES (so the head keeps moving) and tab y READS random ranges while it
//! adopts x's heads — and WRITES too, in bursts deep enough to queue behind
//! its own commit. The ORACLE is the node's own tree at the head y stands on,
//! read from the node, never from y, with y's own writes that are still in
//! flight applied on top in the order y made them (read-your-writes). A read
//! is right when it equals the oracle at the head y stood on when the read
//! began, or at the head it had adopted when it ended.
//!
//! Checked on every read: it equals the oracle (inv. 2), and it ENDS — an
//! answer within a bounded number of hops, never a ticketless refusal or a
//! loop (inv. 8). Checked at rest: y's writes settled, y on the final head,
//! y's full read is the node's final tree; no ticket left open; nothing left
//! in the INTERIM overlay.
//!
//! A FAST phase: x writes on EVERY step while y reads on every step, so the
//! head moves faster than walks finish (the architect's chase).
//!
//! THE LOOP RULE (as `write_path_model.rs`): every loop that waits advances a
//! clock or is bounded, and fails by name.
