//! PUBLISH-LIFE (sdk#485 D; craftworks-docs docs/design/PUBLISH-LIFE.md): a LABEL's publication -- the head's, or a
//! site's -- as ONE enum per label whose cases carry their data, changed by ONE transition, [`Life::on`].
//!
//! ONE WRITER, BY TYPE: every label's `Life` lives in [`Pubs`], whose fields are private to this module; its ONLY
//! `&mut` method is [`Pubs::on`], which hands the event to the label's [`Life::on`] (private here too). Outside this
//! module a `Life` can be read, never written: the compiler holds the rule. The transition never sends: it returns
//! [`Act`]s, which the page carries out (a sign under a fresh id, an UPDATE, a register
//! read, an engine event). Every `match` over the state and the event names every case: a new one fails to compile
//! until the table has a cell for it.
//!
//! The doc's cells, by state (head table / site table):
//! * `Idle` -- nothing owed. `Reading` -- a site whose version is not read yet. `Checking` -- a site read ONLY, never
//!   signed: an app publish's first step (APP-PUBLISH P6), before any piece.
//! * `Signing` -- a Sign out (its id is DERIVED from the op on the wire, never stored).
//! * `BackingOff` -- a retryable refusal; the next Sign at `at` (P6: [`backoff`]).
//! * `OldSigner` -- an OLD signer refuses `Forked` on the head this page stands on: not re-asked until a head read
//!   shows the register past `at` (⁴).
//! * `Written` -- UPDATE sent with the signer's record; read back until it shows (P4).
//! * `Verifying` / `Landing` -- the head only: invariant 1b's read of a `NotNext`/`Forked`, and landing the signer's
//!   record one behind the register.
//! * `Ended` -- a site's end (Published / Superseded / Refused / Cancelled).

// No catch-all over a state or an event: a new case fails the build until the table has its cell (clippy, run by
// the gate with -D warnings).
