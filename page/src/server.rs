//! # The page's protocol SERVER (sdk wiring, main's ruling B)
//!
//! The web Session's `Db` → `CachedStore` → `sdk::Client` speak the page ↔
//! engine protocol. Until now the engine delegate's Shell answered it; here
//! the PAGE does, over [`crate::Page`] (#215): the real engine, whose node
//! work is the client-API executor and whose head the SIGNER signs. Nothing
//! above it changes, so every client-side model still judges it.
//!
//! **Ported VERBATIM from `engine-delegate/src/shell.rs` at b0ab729** (line
//! numbers below are e17711d's; b0ab729 adds only `reads: Vec::new()` and the
//! two `State::Conflict` arms, ported as they are) (main's
//! condition 1) — the protocol half of the Shell, not its node half (the
//! scheduler, read-backs and own-key head signing, which `Page` replaced):
//! * `serve` — `engine-delegate/src/serve.rs` (v5 and above answered
//!   `Unsupported`, as there);
//! * `on_protocol` — shell.rs 796–979; the one change: the event goes to
//!   `Page::event` and its effects are read back through `Page::take_client`;
//! * `reply_from` — shell.rs 1139–1279; the one change: `At` from
//!   `Page::published`;
//! * `attribute` / `step` — shell.rs 1287–1308 / 775–788; `attribute` takes
//!   the client's bytes rather than an `Inbound`;
//! * the identity / already-installed / unserved answers and the per-effect
//!   trace steps — shell.rs `handle`, 606–646 and 671–711;
//! * `as_client` / `version_of` / `session_of` / `as_*`, `reply_bytes`,
//!   `rows_in`, `state_tag` and the page constants — shell.rs 163–296.
//!
//! The differential (`tests/server_differential.rs`) holds it to the Shell:
//! the same requests, the same replies, modulo the head's signer.
