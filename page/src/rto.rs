//! The retry clock of EVERY node call on the page path (main's B2 ruling): an
//! RFC 6298 retransmission timeout over completed calls, and — for block GETs
//! — a congestion window. Nothing here is fixed; both move with what the node
//! does (the owner: per call, adaptive, moving with the network).
//!
//! The same rules as the cold reader (`craftworks_sdk::cold`, sdk#212), kept
//! here because the page crate does not depend on the SDK crate:
//! * `RTO = SRTT + 4·RTTVAR`, a [`RTO_FLOOR_MS`] floor, [`RTO_INITIAL_MS`]
//!   before any sample, [`RTO_MAX_MS`] ceiling;
//! * KARN'S RULE — a call that was re-sent is never a sample: which copy was
//!   answered is unknowable;
//! * §5.5 BACK-OFF — a timeout doubles the RTO (once per tick, however many
//!   timed out in it), until a call answers on its first send;
//! * the WINDOW — start [`WINDOW_INITIAL`], +1 per answer below the slow-start
//!   threshold, +1 per window above it, halved on a LOSS EPISODE (the page
//!   decides what one is: a GET's first timeout, sent after the last halving;
//!   sdk#345), the threshold set there, never below [`WINDOW_FLOOR`].
