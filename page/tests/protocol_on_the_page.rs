//! THE PROTOCOL'S RULES, ON THE PAGE (re-stated from the Shell's
//! `engine-delegate/tests/shell.rs`, deleted with the Shell).
//!
//! `page::Server` answers the same protocol the Shell did, so the rules the
//! Shell's tests pinned are pinned here on it: a message is read exactly or
//! not at all, what cannot be understood is refused by name, Identity says
//! whether the head can be written and which contract it is, and a subscribed
//! range is pushed a `Changed` for a commit inside it — and nothing for one
//! outside it.
