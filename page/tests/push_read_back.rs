//! A SAVE'S READ-BACK, AND THE NODE'S PUSH (sdk#378 P2 + P3, the architect's rulings). Every node op is one place
//! on the node's ONE queue (F61), so a save sends no register read it does not need:
//! - P2: while this page's own read-back is owed (its UPDATE is out), a `HeadChanged` hint starts no second read:
//!   the read-back reads the register and judges whatever it holds.
//! - P3: a pushed FULL state showing EXACTLY this page's owed head is the read-back (judged by the one read-back
//!   rule); anything else is the hint it always was, and a dropped push leaves the read-back GET to its deadline.
