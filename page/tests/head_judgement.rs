//! ONE HEAD-JUDGEMENT FOR EVERY REGISTER ANSWER (sdk#396, safety gap (a) of the 2026-09-24 stock-take). A register
//! answer can reach the page as a recovery read (the engine's own `ReadHead` mid-commit), a read-back, a verify or
//! a hint, and every one of them is judged by the same rule before anything is adopted: a head at THIS page's
//! record's seq, under another root that this page's record BEATS in the Register's tie-break, is never adopted --
//! the register will hold mine once my UPDATE merges (the architect's attack on sdk#225, case 1).
