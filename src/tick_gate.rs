//! AT MOST ONE UNANSWERED TICK PER SESSION, ALWAYS (craftworks-sdk#174).
//!
//! Every frame a page sends is one delegate call, and the node runs a
//! delegate's calls one at a time behind a queue of 8 (the 9th is refused;
//! F50). A delegate parked on the network for 30 s used to collect a tick a
//! second from every tab — thirty stale times, each costing a queue slot, and
//! the queue filled (sdk#173). A tick says only "it is now T"; a second one
//! sent before the first is answered says nothing the first will not, and
//! the first call AFTER the wait should carry the time as it is then.
//!
//! So a tick goes out only when this session has none unanswered. "Answered"
//! is read off the per-call report: the delegate emits exactly one
//! `Reply::Call { saw: Client, .. }` for every client frame it runs, on the
//! connection that sent it, in the order they ran. Counting frames sent
//! against those reports says whether the tick's frame has run.
//!
//! A frame the node refuses (a full queue) or a connection that drops
//! mid-send is never answered, so `answered` falls behind `sent`. What undoes
//! that is the forgetting: a tick unanswered for [`FORGET_MS`] is dropped AND
//! the lag behind it is written off (counted answered), and the next one
//! goes. Both halves are needed, and both are measured
//! (`testkit/tests/one_tick_at_a_time.rs`): without the forgetting one lost
//! reply stops the delegate's clock for good; without the write-off it
//! slows it to one tick per [`FORGET_MS`] for good, 6 ticks in 60 s instead
//! of 51, because every later tick waits on an answer that already went to
//! the frame before it.
//!
//! The write-off's price, stated: if the forgotten frame was only SLOW and is
//! answered later, that answer is counted twice, and the gate opens one
//! frame early once. So "at most one unanswered" holds except after a silence
//! of [`FORGET_MS`], where it is at most two.
//!
//! The same shape bounds `AskWrite` (the continuation of a parked write): at
//! most one unanswered at a time, forgotten on the same terms.

/// How long an unanswered tick (or ask) holds the gate shut.
///
/// Sized from how long a queued frame can LEGITIMATELY wait, which the node
/// states: a parked delegate works for at most `PARK_WORK_BUDGET` = 75 s and
/// is dropped at `PARK_TTL` = 90 s (F50, freenet-core's delegate park, read
/// at the pinned version). An answer later than 100 s is one the node never
/// ran. Shorter would forget ticks that are merely queued: at 10 s a 30 s
/// park held 4 ticks per tab (measured), and under the 75 s budget every
/// long park would double each tab's ticks.
///
/// The cost, stated: one lost tick reply freezes this session's share of the
