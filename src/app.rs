//! THE APP NAMESPACE (the forest ruling): a person has ONE tree, divided by
//! app. Every name an app uses — a domain, or a watch key (`domain` or
//! `domain#parent`) — is RELATIVE to it and stored as `<app>.<name>`, so an app
//! has no name for another app's data and cannot write it. Another app's data
//! is READ through the absolute `@app/name` form (`db.other(app)`); it is
//! never written. `.` separates the app from the name: an app id has none.
//!
//! Pure functions, so the rules are tested natively (tests/app_namespace.rs);
//! the web Session applies them at every name that crosses into it.
