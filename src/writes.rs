//! THE WRITE HALF of the page's store (R-b; READ-STATE § The pull API).
//!
//! The ENGINE owns the write queue: order, the rebuild, `Lost` and go-back-N,
//! the bound (`QueueFull`), every verdict. What is left here is what only
//! this client can know:
//! * the FRAMING: a write made here is minted an id and framed onto the wire
//!   ([`Client`]), and handed to the engine at once (the door is synchronous
//!   in the page);
//! * which keys each of ITS OWN writes touched, until the write ends -- so a
//!   row whose write ended can be named (re-rendered, or shown rolled back);
//! * what the APP has been told: fates are PULLED from the page's `Server`
//!   ([`Writes::on_fate`]) and turned into the notices the app drains.
//!
//! Nothing here times a write out, re-sends one, or holds one back: a queued
//! write's only exits are the named fates the engine gives it (sdk#291: the
//! outbox's 60 s timeout rolled back writes that were only waiting their
//! turn -- 34 of 3,000 paced puts, gone, with "saving" reading 0).
