//! THE SDK'S STATUS VOCABULARY (sdk#518): every word a session's status methods answer, each set owned by ONE enum
//! with `code()` and `ALL`. The session emits through these (`web/src/session.rs`), `status_words` exports them as one
//! list, and an app imports that list (`sdk.status`) -- never a copy of its own. `RowState` (store.rs) is the row's.
