//! An id a read cannot address answers ABSENT, not a refusal.
//!
//! The ids reaching `get` come from outside the program: a `lastOpened` value
//! in browser storage written by an older build, a pasted link, a record
//! deleted on another device. For every one of those the honest answer is
//! *absent*, which `get` already has a representation for — it returns `None`
//! for an id that parses but is not there.
//!
//! Making "malformed" a different CONTROL-FLOW outcome from "missing" forces
//! every caller holding an outside id into a `try`, and the one that forgets
//! is the one that crashes. That is the library deciding the caller's control
//! flow (craftworks-sdk#118).
//!
//! **One shape in the issue is now stale and is corrected here.** It lists a
//! 64-character id among the malformed inputs. Since #122 a 64-hex id is a
//! VALID id — a record keyed under a parent — so the table below tests it as
//! valid-but-absent rather than as nonsense, and covers 48 and 65 instead.
//! The stale-id case is also no longer hypothetical: a component id stored
//! before #122 is 32 hex where the domain now wants 64.
