//! A COLD WRITE, against a REAL engine.
//!
//! The JavaScript test for this drives a FAKE session. It is worth having —
//! it is the path an app takes — but it exercises the retry LOOP and never
//! the parking underneath it, which is the half that decides whether there is
//! anything to retry.
//!
//! Measured, in review: with the recovery inline in `web/src/session.rs`, the
//! sdk#89 defect could be put straight back — `define` returning a ticketless
//! `NotLoaded` — and the whole suite stayed green. The defect that cost five
//! acceptance runs was reintroducible with nothing to show for it.
//!
//! So the decision lives in the SDK (`PageStore::decide`, READ-STATE), where
//! this drives it against the page path's engine and node.
//!
//! What a cold write IS: somebody's tree is on the node, this page has read
//! none of its blocks, and the very first thing it does is `define` a domain.
//! That define must read the existing schema before it can check the new one
//! against it, and the walk to it stops on blocks this page does not hold.
