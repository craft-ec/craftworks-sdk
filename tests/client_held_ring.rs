//! The delegate's per-call report, recorded where it can be read.
//!
//! `Reply::Call` exists because a delegate prints nothing and the node says
//! nothing about it, so five different breaks in the write path all presented
//! as one symptom — a write that stops at `Accepted`. Until now the engine
//! emitted it and nothing read it, so a page had no answer to "why did my
//! write stop".
//!
//! This recording ships: it is the production support tool, the same bounded
//! buffer in a user's app as in a test, and "report a problem" exports it. So
//! the tests here are about what it must NOT contain as much as what it must.
