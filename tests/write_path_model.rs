//! THE WRITE PATH'S MODEL, over the REAL engine queue (R-b).
//!
//! Before R-b this model drove the client's outbox (`CachedStore`) against a
//! SCRIPTED node that answered `Busy`, dropped and misrouted verdicts, refused
//! past its queue and forgot its context; its pinned sweep table was what
//! sdk#265, #249 and #235 were proven against. The outbox and the delegate it
//! was a client of are gone: the engine owns the queue in the page, a write's
//! fate is PULLED, and nothing on the client times out, re-sends or holds a
//! write back. So the scripted node is replaced by the real one -- two TABS
//! OF ONE PERSON (two pages, one node, one signer, one Register) racing, whose
//! same-seq races are real foreign moves -- and the faults are the ones a
//! node still has: answers HELD and released one at a time (reordered across
//! the two tabs), answers LOST (the page's own deadlines re-ask), and the
//! clock JUMPING forward. The PROPERTIES are kept (the mapping table in the PR
//! says where each old assertion lives now):
//!
//! * NO WRITE IS LOST SILENTLY (W4, sdk#291): every write made ends exactly
//!   once -- refused at its door by name, Published, or in a NAMED fate the
//!   app was told. "Vanished, never told" is counted and must be 0.
//! * VALUE PARITY WITH THE TREE (W4/W6 as revised, the false rollback): at
//!   rest, each key holds the value of the LAST write made on it that ended
//!   Published -- so a write told it fell is not in the tree, and one told
//!   Published is (unless the same tab wrote the key again after it).
//! * ORDER (W2, go-back-N): per key, the tree never holds an older write's
//!   value over a later Published one of the same tab (the parity check,
//!   which knows make order).
//! * FORCED -> LOST NAMED (sdk#235): a forced write whose commit dies is told
//!   so, as forced; it never lands after being told.
//! * AT REST: nothing unsaved, the queue empty, no `Busy`, and no rebuilt
//!   commit that differed from its warm root (K9).
//!
//! Not here, and where they are: dependants re-run in app order is `Db`'s
//! (page/tests/server_differential.rs, the chain and budget tests); a write's
//! frame carrying exactly its ops is `tests/writes.rs`.
//!
//! THE LOOP RULE: every loop that waits advances the clock or is bounded, and
//! fails by name.
