// THE LIVE PATH: what makes a binding show data it did not have.
//
// A binding's `reload` used to read the LOCAL COPY and return early when its
// root had not moved — and nothing moved the copy's root, so a tab that made
// no write could never see another's. There is no copy now (READ-STATE): a
// read walks the engine's tree, and on a head move the SESSION says which
// LIVE ranges changed (the tree's diff from each binding's `RenderedAt`,
// `LiveBindings`, tested natively in testkit/tests/read_state_model.rs). What
// this pins is the JavaScript half: the page asks the session on every
// message, and re-runs exactly the bindings it names.
//
// Driven through the ENTRY with a fake socket playing the engine, because
// that is the path an app takes and the one every previous gate missed.
