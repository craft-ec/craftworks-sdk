//
// Every other test in this repo imports the thing it tests from the file that
// defines it. That is a test of the file, not of the SDK, and twice now it has
// been green over code no app could reach:
//
//   * #63 merged with `engine-db.js` calling `handle.onReadsWake` and nothing
//     anywhere defining it, and with the engine path not exported at all;
//   * #64's first attempt added `open()` to `session.js` and its test imported
//     it from there, while `wrap()` — the entry — still returned only the two
//     halves an app can wire wrongly.
//
// Both times every gate passed. So this one goes through the ENTRY, exactly as
// an app does: `wrap(raw)`, then only what that returns.
