// literal that spreads the process environment. So every test file builds a child's environment through the ONE helper,
// tests/js/common/child-env.mjs, and this scan holds it: no file under tests/js spreads `process.env` itself, except
// the helper and a line marked `// LEAK CONTROL` (a control that proves a leak is real). Read at test time, so a new
