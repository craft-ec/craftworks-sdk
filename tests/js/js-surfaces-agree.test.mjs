// THE TWO JAVASCRIPT SURFACES MUST AGREE TOO.
//
// `web/tests/surfaces_agree.rs` compares the two WASM objects. That is half
// the boundary: an app does not hold a wasm object, it holds what `wrap()`
// and `engineDb()` return — and `bind` lives there, on neither wasm side.
//
// So `engineDb` had no `bind` at all, and a published project threw
// `db.bind is not a function` the moment it rendered. Every gate was green:
// the Rust one compared the wrong pair of objects, and no JavaScript one
// existed. "Publish switches the backend and the app code does not change"
// has to be true of the object a component actually holds.
//
// AND THE NAME IS NOT THE SURFACE. This file then compared names only, and
// the very next instance of the same failure walked straight through it: the
// engine-backed `schema` and `count` are ASYNC — they read over the network —
// and the in-memory ones answered values. An app got a Promise where it
// expected an object, and a Promise is truthy, so it passed an
// `if (!schema)` guard and arrived at `schema.fields.map` as `undefined.map`.
//
// Measured against a real node (sdk#87): four defects in the builder, three
// of which replaced the whole app with an exception string while the button
// said "Published", and one of which printed "— [object Promise] records" to
// a person — a wrong number, no crash, nothing would have reported it.
//
// So the second gate below compares what each method ANSWERS WITH: a promise
// or a value. An app must not be able to tell which backend it has from the
// shape of an answer.
