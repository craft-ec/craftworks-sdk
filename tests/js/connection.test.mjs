// The socket wrapper, against a fake WebSocket.
//
// The defect this file exists for: the first version took the engine's whole
// outbound queue and broke out of the send loop when the socket refused, so
// everything taken and not sent was dropped. Its own comment said the engine
// still had them — it did not, because the take had already happened. A write
// made before `onopen` is the ORDINARY start of a session, so the normal path
// lost its first write silently.
//
// Every test here runs the real `connect()` over a fake socket whose open/close
// the test controls. The engine is faked too, and deliberately: what is under
// test is the wrapper's contract with the engine — take nothing you cannot
// send, confirm exactly what went, in order — and a real engine would make the
// assertions about queue contents harder to read without making them stronger.
