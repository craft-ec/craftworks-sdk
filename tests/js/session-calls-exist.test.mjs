// EVERY CALL THE PAGE MAKES MUST EXIST ON THE REAL SESSION.
//
// Every other JavaScript test in this repo drives a FAKE `Session`, and that
// is deliberate: a test that needed a node and a browser would not run. But
// it means the whole JS suite is green over a `session.whatever()` that the
// wasm does not have — the fake answers it, the real object throws
// `is not a function`, and the first thing to find out is an app.
//
// That is not hypothetical. This file was written because two new calls
// (`tick_ms`, `flush`) went into `js/session.js` in the same change that
// added them to the wasm; had the `#[wasm_bindgen]` attribute been missing
// from either, every gate here would still have passed.
//
// So this one reads the BUILT bindings — `pkg/web/craftworks_sdk.d.ts`,
// which wasm-bindgen generates from what is actually exported — and checks
// the page against them.
