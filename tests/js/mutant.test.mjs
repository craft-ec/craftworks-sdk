// THE MUTANT HELPER (tools/mutant.sh, sdk#391): one place that applies a mutant, runs the test, says

// bit sdk#389: a restore that brought back an older mtime left cargo's build on the last mutant.
//
// Everything runs against a throwaway crate in a temp dir with its own CARGO_TARGET_DIR, so no
// real source is ever mutated. MUTANT_UNDER_TEST names another copy of the helper (its mutants).
