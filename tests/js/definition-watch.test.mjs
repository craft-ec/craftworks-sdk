// WATCH A DEFINITION (§19 P3, `watchDefinition`) on the engine-backed surface, over a recording session.
//
// What the session decides (which watch key a head move changed) is tested natively (tests/definition_watch.rs);
// this is the JavaScript half: the watch is bound through the session's door (never by spelling the reserved name),
// a key `take_stale` names re-reads `definition(which)` and records `rendered_definition` IN THE SAME SYNCHRONOUS
// CALL as that read, every watcher gets the rows, unwatch unbinds, and a door that refuses is thrown by name.
