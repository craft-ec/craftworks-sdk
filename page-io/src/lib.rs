//! # page-io: the page executor's I/O over Freenet's client API (ruling B, part 2)
//!
//! [`page::server::Server`] answers the page ↔ engine protocol in-process and
//! emits [`page::Op`]s; this crate is the ONLY place they become client-API
//! frames (`wire`, `wire::signer`) and the node's answers become
//! [`page::Answer`]s again (main's condition 3: no other path to the node).
//! Sans-IO like everything under it: frames in, frames out, and the time.
//!
//! | op | frame |
//! |---|---|
//! | `Put { id, bytes }` | PUT of the Block contract for `id` (`wire::block`), state `kind ‖ body` |
//! | `Get { id }` | GET of that contract |
//! | `ReadHead` | GET **with subscribe** of the head Register: on a peered node a delegate-created register is not served to a bare GET (F55), and the subscription is how a head move reaches the page |
//! | `Update { state }` | the first head this page has never seen a register for → PUT of the Register contract (it CREATES it); after that, UPDATE |
//! | `Sign { id, .. }` | `wire::signer::frame_sign` under the request's own id (SG02) |
//! | `AskHeld { batch, ids }` | ONE `wire::signer::frame_held` of the blocks' contracts (1..=MAX_HELD, sdk#455) |
//!
//! | answer | becomes |
//! |---|---|
//! | `Got` of the Register | `Head(record)`; the register now exists |
//! | NotFound of the Register | `Head(None)` ONLY if the signer holds no record for it (asked once, `ask_record`); otherwise silence — re-asked on the RTO with no end, shown as "not answering for N s" (sdk#175; a peered NotFound can be false, F55) |
//! | a REFUSED GET (`ContractError::Get`) of anything | nothing: it says nothing about the contract, so it is not an answer — re-asked on the RTO (rule 7), never read as absent |
//! | `Got` of a block | `Got { id, body }` (the executor verifies it against its id) |
//! | NotFound of a block | `GetMissed` |
//! | `Ack(Put)` of a block | `PutOk` |
//! | `Ack(Put)` / `Ack(Updated)` of the Register | `Updated` (it says nothing more, F56); the register exists |
//! | a signer answer | `Signer { id, answer }`; a `Held { present }` goes back to the blocks its id asked about |
//! | `Ack(Put)` / `PutFailed` of any OTHER contract | handed back unread ([`PageIo::take_others`]): the app's own PUTs ([`PageIo::put_contract`], builder#104) are the caller's to match |
//!
//! THE FIRST-PUT RACE: two pages on one key both see no register and both
//! PUT it. The signer signs ONE record from the genesis (at most one
//! signature per prev), so the second page is answered `AlreadySigned` with
//! the FIRST record and PUTs the same bytes: an equal decision, the held
//! bytes win (F56 only ever displaced DIFFERENT roots). Neither PUT fails;
//! the loser's own commit is judged by the read-back and told `Lost`.
