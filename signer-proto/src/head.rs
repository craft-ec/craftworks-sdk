//! THE HEAD VALUE: what a Register record says the head is. The ONE reader and writer of its layout.
//!
//! ```text
//! record = RG01 | flags | terminal | seq (u64 LE) | vlen (u16 LE) | value | sig      (the Register's own framing)
//! value  = root [32] ‖ ledger
//! ledger = (empty) | version u8 ‖ field*       field = tag u8 ‖ len u16 LE ‖ bytes, tags strictly ascending
//! ```
//!
//! **Root first**, deliberately: a reader that takes the value's first 32 bytes as the root stays right whatever
//! follows. A leading version byte would have made such a reader take `version ‖ 31 root bytes` for a root, which is
//! silently wrong, not a refusal. An EMPTY ledger (a bare 32-byte value) is valid forever: every head before this
//! format.
//!
//! Fields (the architect's review, docs 2026-09-23-ledger-format-attack.md, ruled by main):
//! * [`TAG_PREV`] `prev_seq u64 LE ‖ prev_root [32]`: the head this one was signed from. Omitted at the genesis,
//!   never zeros.
//! * [`TAG_PARITY`]: since ledger version 2, the race-put MARK (COMMIT-LIFE §P): an EMPTY field means "every group
//!   this head lists was recoverable (k of k+m) when it was signed". A head without it is pre-§P, and a reader says
//!   `NotScanned` for it. In version 1 the tag carried #119's scan front, a different meaning, so a v1 parity field
//!   is DROPPED on read, never taken for the mark. At most [`PARITY_MAX`] bytes.
//! * [`TAG_THROUGH`] `n u16 ‖ n × (device [16] ‖ seq u64 LE ‖ last u64 LE)`, sorted by device, unique: how far each
//!   device's writes are published, and when each last wrote. `device` is a per-INSTALL id minted once and kept in the
//!   signer's secret store, never derived from the key (one key can be shared across devices until #226).
//!
//! **Reading is TOLERANT, from this format on, for every reader** (main's ruling: apps pin an SDK rev for life, so this
//! is the last head change an old reader cannot survive). The root is the first 32 bytes. A ledger is parsed if one is
//! present; an unknown tag is SKIPPED; a longer device list than this build would write is READ, not refused. A ledger
//! that is malformed (out of order, duplicated, truncated, a known field of the wrong shape) or of an unknown VERSION
//! is read as NO ledger (`refused`), and a head is never "no head" because of its ledger. A reader must treat a
//! refused ledger as "no prev" (the merge's conservative cell), never as "built on mine".
//!
//! **The version** bumps only when an existing tag's MEANING changes, so that an old reader would be wrong. Adding a
//! tag never bumps it: old readers skip the new tag.
//!
//! **Writing** ([`value`]) normalises: devices sorted and unique, the list evicted to [`THROUGH_MAX`] by least
//! recently written (the lowest `last`, then the lowest device id: deterministic, so both sides of a merge evict the
//! same entry). It never refuses: a refusal past the bound would be an identity that can never write again. The
//! SIGNER checks a value with [`check`] before it signs, the one place a malformed ledger can be stopped.
