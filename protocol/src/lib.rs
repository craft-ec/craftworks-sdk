//! What the SDK and the engine say to each other.
//!
//! **Every message starts with a version, from the very first one.** Not
//! because v2 is planned, but because a protocol that has to be versioned
//! LATER cannot be: the messages already in flight have nowhere to put the
//! number, and the only way to tell them apart is to guess from their shape.
//! ARCHITECTURE §19 — every published version keeps working — is a promise
//! that can only be kept by something that could always tell versions apart.
//!
//! Three rules follow, and each has a test:
//!
//! 1. A version this build does not know is answered [`Reply::Unsupported`],
//!    listing what it does know. Never silence, and never a guess at what the
//!    sender meant.
//! 2. Decoding is EXACT. `bincode::deserialize` accepts trailing bytes — it
//!    decodes the type it was asked for and ignores the rest — which is how
//!    one message is read as another. A wrapped value decoded as its wrapper
//!    returns the wrapper's first variant and throws the answer away.
//! 3. Records are append-only and unknown fields are PRESERVED byte for byte
//!    (see [`Record`]). An SDK that rewrites a record it did not fully author
//!    must not silently delete what a newer build put there.

/// sends v2-only messages ONLY to a client that said it speaks v2. A v1
/// client is never sent one at all, so its decoder never has to refuse one.

/// client that spoke v3; an older one is told [`WriteState::Failed`], which
/// means the same thing to it (not in the tree; sending it again is refused
/// again) without a reason it could not read.

/// v4 puts the SESSION on every request and adds [`Reply::SessionWriteState`]

/// How often a connected page sends [`Request::Tick`], in milliseconds.
///
/// # What a tick IS
///
/// The engine has no clock (F32: a delegate gets a fresh linear memory every
/// call, and nothing in it advances time). Every deadline it has — when owed
/// parity goes out, when a stuck commit is called `Stalled` — is measured
/// against the number a client last sent, and against nothing else.
///
/// So the number's MEANING is a decision, and there were two candidates:
///
/// * **How many times my timer fired.** Rejected. A browser throttles a
///   background tab's timers to as little as one a minute, so N ticks would
///   mean anywhere from N seconds to N minutes — the deadline would stretch
///   silently with the thing least worth trusting. Worse, a delegate's
///   context is shared by EVERY connection (F47): a second tab opening would
///   send 1, 2, 3 while the first was at 4000, and `now` would jump
///   backwards, making everything look young again.
///
/// * **The wall clock, quantised.** What this is. `now` is
///   `Date.now() / TICK_MS` — whole seconds since the epoch. Two tabs on one
///   node agree exactly, because they are reading the same clock rather than
///   counting their own events, and a throttled tab sends the right number
///   late instead of a wrong number on time.
///
/// # And the quantum is what the engine's bounds are in
///
/// `Params::parity_age` and `Params::max_accept_age` are counts of this
/// unit. **At `TICK_MS = 1000` they read as seconds, and only then.** They
/// are plain small numbers because of this constant, so moving it rescales
/// every deadline in the engine at once: 32 and 64 become 32 and 64 of
/// whatever the new quantum is, silently, with nothing failing. Anyone
/// changing it converts those params in the same commit, or states in
/// `Params` what the new unit is.
///
/// # A CLIENT'S clock, and what that client can do with it
///
/// The engine has no clock of its own, so this is not a client HELPING with
/// the time — it is the only time there is. A client therefore decides WHEN
/// the engine acts, and the honest way to read the guarantee is: a delegate
/// trusts the wall clock of whoever is connected to it.
///
/// That is fine for the case this is built for — a person's own node, driven
/// by their own tabs. It is worth writing down what it means when it is not.
///
/// A client that lies about the time can:
///
/// * **make deadlines fire early**, by sending a number far in the future.
///   Owed parity goes out before it has coalesced, and a commit in flight is
///   reported `Stalled` sooner than it deserves. Both cost work, and neither
///   is wrong about the DATA;
/// * **make deadlines not fire**, by sending a number that never advances.
///   Owed parity waits and a stuck commit is never called stalled. This is
///   exactly the state before anything sent time at all, so it is a denial
///   of the deadlines, not a corruption.
///
/// It cannot:
///
/// * **change what is written.** Time decides WHEN, never WHAT: every effect
///   a tick produces is one the engine already owed, computed from the tree
///   and not from the number. `Tick` carries no keys, no values and no root;
/// * **move a deadline backwards for somebody else in a way that loses
///   data.** `now` going down makes things look young again — work is
///   delayed, not undone — and the age comparisons saturate rather than
///   wrap;
/// * **be told apart from an honest client by the engine**, which is the
///   actual limit: a delegate's context is shared by every connection (F47),
///   so the LAST tick wins and there is nowhere to record whose it was.
///
/// The bound that matters, then, is on who may connect to a node's delegate,
/// not on what this field says. A shared delegate whose clients are not all
/// trusted needs the time to come from somewhere they do not control, and
/// nothing here provides that.
